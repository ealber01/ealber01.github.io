				<h6>The Problem:</h6>
				<h5>Each year, Americans throw away billions of bounds of food. Food that is thrown away and never consumed contributes to
					both environmental problems and individual economic losses. From the environmental perspective, when organic matter
					decays without oxygen, as it does buried in landfills, it releases methane, which is an extremely potent greenhouse
					gas contributing to climate change. </h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm">
				<h6>The Solution:</h6>
				<h5>The following project aims to develop a mobile application that will combat food waste by monitoring food in household
					refrigerators. The application will allow individuals to reduce the amount of food that is never consumed, which will
					reduce the amount of food that is thrown away.

				<h5>After finalizing our user research, we found that in order to create an application that individuals in our target audience
					will utilize and gain from, we will need a way to make our app social by connecting users with each other and allowing
					them to work together to mitigate wasteful habits.
