				<h6>The Problem:</h6>
				<h5>Each year, Americans throw away billions of bounds of food.
					 Food that is thrown away and never consumed contributes to both 
					 environmental problems and individual economic losses. From the 
					 environmental perspective, when organic matter decays without oxygen, 
					 as it does buried in landfills, it releases methane, which is an extremely 
					 potent greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. </h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm">
				<h6>The Solution:</h6>
				<h5>The following project aims to develop a mobile application that will 
					combat food waste by monitoring food in household refrigerators. 
					The application will allow individuals to reduce the amount of food 
					that is never consumed, which will reduce the amount of food that is 
					thrown away.

						<h5>After finalizing our user research, we found that in order to create an application 
							that individuals in our target audience will utilize and gain from, we will need a 
							way to make our app social by connecting users with each other and allowing them to
							work together to mitigate wasteful habits.

				<h6>Expert Reviews, Focus Groups, and Usability Testing</h6>
				<h5>After conducting expert reviews, focus groups, and usability testing, we obtained feedback that lead us toward our final
					design. The main feedback we received was the following: </br>
					</br>
					(1) The different alignments and sizes of texts seemed disorganized</br>
					</br>
					(2) The information display had good information, but too much new information for regular users to want to read </br>
					</br>
					(3) Participants felt that the colors on the display were too overwhelming</h5>

		<h6>Final Designs</h6>
		<h4> The design we recommend is a 3 part design that consists of (1) an information display at the entrance, (2) a platform
			display, and (3) a mobile application.</h4></br>

				<h4>
					</br>Information Display</br>
				</h4>
				<h5>
					We found that users wanted to see the displayed information as early as possible. For this reason, we designed an information
					display that will be on display at the entrance of the station. From our user requirements and usability testing, we
					found that users wanted a simple display that clearly showed the capacity of each car. The blue was chosen because users
					felt that the red, yellow, and green cars were too colorful. 
				</h5>
			</div>
		</div>
		<hr>
		<div class="row center">
			<div class="col-sm">
				<h4>
					</br>Platform Display</h4>
				<h5> From our initial focus group feedback, we decided to go with a design that displayed a visual of each carâ€™s crowding
					level above the train. Again, our user testing participants preferred the standard blue to display crowding levels.</h5>

				<h4>
					</br>Mobile Application</br>
				</h4>
				<h5>From our usability testing, we found that users generally had a really easy time navigating through the application.
					All users appreciated having a mobile application in addition to the informational displays at the platform because
					this would allow them to check the crowding level of stations before ever entering the stations.</h5>
