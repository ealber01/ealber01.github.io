				<h6>Passion</h6>
				<h5>Human factors engineering is a combination of both engineering and psychology. I am passionate about improving the way
					people interact with technology. People gravitate toward tecnology that is easy to understand, simple to navigate, and
					offers a great overall user experience. My goal as a human factors engineer is to use my knowledge of human physical
					and psychological characteristics to develop products that leave a positive impact on their users. I am adept at understanding
					the needs of a user and translating them into actionable customer insights that form empathetic and thoughtful designs.

			<h5>
				</br>The design of a product or service speaks a lot to the success of a company. I first began designing applications in
				a user interface design course. Since then, my design skills have grown from internships and other opportunities where
				my design skills could be used. The past two summers. I've worked as a user experience designer. I have gone through
				the process of designing, building, and testing fully interactive prototypes for different software programs. Because
				these interfaces are still in working progress, I'm not able to add them to my portfolio. My experience designing hypothetical
				interfaces for creative products, along with my experience designing complex interfaces for software companies has given
				me a wide range of skills in user experience design.</h5>
