Lab 4
COMP 20

1. For Lab 4, I was able to create an html page for my bio, resume, and index. My bio uses CSS Style coding, and my other two pages only use HTML coding. It seems that all aspects of the work have been correctly implemented. 
2. Lab 4 was done alone.
3. Approximately 3 hours were spent on Lab 4.
