				<h6>The Problem:</h6>
				<h5>Donating is a great way to help those who are less fortunate than us. Unfortunately,
					most people don't exactly know what they're doing when they donate clothes.
				</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm">
				<h6>The Solution:</h6>
				<h5>The following project aimed to design a second hand clothing website where users can 
					donate old clothing or request a certain donation. The high level goal of the website 
					are for it: (1) to allow for simple and easy donation process and (2) to have a clean 
					design providing only critical information.
				</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm">
				<h6>The Approach:</h6>
				<h5>1. Discover target users </br>
					</br>
					2. Understand customer insights
				</br></br>
					3. Research competing companies
				</h5>

		<h6>Personas</h6>
		<h5>The website will have three layers of users: (1) Businesses that volunteer
			 to help our project, (2) Users looking for donations, (3) Users looking 
			 to donate items. </br></h5>

				<h4>Business Persona</br></h4>
				<h5>Laundromasters is a laundromat service located just minutes from Magoun Square in Somerville, MA. Established in 1966, Laundromasters will be celebrating its 50th birthday in May. 
					To celebrate, owner Pat Healy is offering free laundering services to needing members in the local community.
					Pat and the Healy Family, life-long residents of Somerville and patrons of the Somerville Homeless Coalition, are always 
					looking for ways to assist and support others. Pat has looked online for creative ways to donate or volunteer services.

				<h4>Donation Receiver Persona</br></h4>
				<h5></br> Mary Anderson is two months shy of 40. Mary lives in the small town of Hamilton, 
					Massachusetts with her 14-year-old twin daughters Lily and Maxx. Her daughters just 
					entered their freshman year in their towns’ public high school. After Mary’s divorce 
					last year, her budget for her daughters’ everyday essentials has dramatically decreased. 
					Mary has recently found interest in shopping at Goodwill and other second hand clothing stores. 
					She has been able to purchase clothing with some of her favorite labels for a bargain.

					<h4>Donator Persona</br></h4>
					<h5>Hillary is a 36-year-old stay-at-home mother who lives in Jamaica Plain, MA, with her husband,
						 13-year-old daughter and 6-year-old twin sons. During college, Hillary volunteered at homeless shelters
						  and elementary schools in impoverished neighborhoods. When her daughter started to grow out of her clothes,
						Hilary decided to donate the clothes to those in need.

				<h6>Focus Group</h6>
				<h5>We conducted a focus group of 7 participants. Two of these participants were 
					Tufts students (age 22), one was a retired military engineering (age 75),
					 one was a retired elementary school teacher (age 74), one was a current elementary 
					 school teacher (age 24), one was a motivational speaker on mental health and advocacy 
					 (age 23) and one was a medical professional (age 55). </h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm">
				<h4> Results</h4>
				<h5>Many of them said they felt that if donors had to go through and find
						a match for a request for their clothing, it put a lot of effort on
						 the donors, and would be a deterrent for them. It was suggested that 
						 some system be incorporated in which donors could post an inventory of
						  the clothes and be alerted every time someone posted a request that 
						  matched an item in their inventory. This way, Me2You wouldn’t have to
						   have a warehouse full of inventory, but it would take some of the work 
						   off of the donor as they wouldn’t have to scroll through requests.</h5>

		<h6>Initial Designs</h6>
		<h5>Two design concepts were formed that would create polarizing designs. 
				There are many aesthetic differences between the two including: 
				(1) pictures vs flat color, (2) cool, calming pastel tones vs vivid, 
				richer color palette, and (3) formal vs informal display of information.</h5>

		<h6>Usabiltiy Testing and Final Designs</h6>
		<div class="row center">
			<h5>After some usability testing, we were able to incorporate user suggestions into one final design. 
				Users appreciated our large text, clear and accessible information, Icons/Images, color scheme, 
				and the emotional connection we created. There was some confusion with the navigation of the website 
				and how to complete certain tasks.</h5>		
			<div class="col-sm">	
				<img src="./m2.png" height="400" width="300" />
				<h5>The final design shows a warm and thoughtful landing page that will draw users in. 
					Users in search of filling an individuals request have the ability to view the current 
					requests on the website, allowing them a more direct way of seeing their clothes go to 
					a good cause.</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm">
				<img src="./m3.png" height="300" width="320" />
				<h5>Because individuals requesting clothes will come from different backgrounds and have 
						different technical capabilities, it was important to create an intuitive clothing 
						request form that allows individuals to request clothes without any confusion.
