				<h6>The Problem</h6>
				<h5>Students at highly rigorous academic institutions have a hard time 
					balancing sleep, eating healthy, exercising, and maintaining their grades. 
					As four college students, we felt that our intense schedules and lack of time 
					lead us to behaviors that leave us unable to feel our best. With our diverse 
					backgrounds in computer science, biology, econ, and sociology, we set out to 
					find a solution to this widespread problem.

				</h5>

			<div class="col-sm">
				<h6>The Solution</h6>
				<h5>Antiox is an up and coming startup within the healthcare industry that offers a 
					transdermal patch with vitamins and antioxidants in it. Our product offers a mobile 
					application that makes buying vitamin patches convenient and easily understandable. 
					Our goal is to increase the daily lives of students at academically rigorous and 
					stressful institutions in the Greater Boston Area.

					<h4>My Role</h4>
					<h5> As project manager, I was responsible with planning and overseeing all aspects 
						of the project. My expertise in executing the user-centered design process allowed me
						to design a product that was geared toward our target users. 	
					</br></br>
						My role as project manager gave me the important experience of learning how to 
						build and maintain a strong team. By overseeing the initiation, planning, execution,
						and closure of this project, I gained many practical skills that I have since been able to utilize
						when working on cross-functional teams.

			<h6> Our Product</h6>
			<h5>Antiox offers a transdermal patch with vitamins and antioxidants that help students to feel their best at 
				all times. To better cater to individuals in our target market, we have designed a mobile app to provide our product and to
				make purchasing easier. After surveying individuals in our target audience, we decided to focus our patches on 
				solving three main issues. The first will be an immune and skin care patch. Our third and final patch 
				will be a hangover patch. 
				</h5>	
			<h4> Value</h4>	
			<h5> The value that Antiox offers students is the ability to maintain a healthy balance between
				 sleep, physical health, mental health, and academic success. Our patch allows vitamins and 
				 antioxidants to diffuse across the skin over just a few hours, much faster than other daily vitamins. 
				 Antiox gives students the solution to remain healthy while living their not-so healthy lifestyles.
