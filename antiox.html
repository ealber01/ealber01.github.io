						My role as project manager gave me the important experience of learning how to 
						build and maintain a strong team. By overseeing the initiation, planning, execution,
						and closure of this project, I gained many practical skills that I can later utilize
						when working on cross-functional teams.

			<h4>Market </h4>

				their health and wellness. The market is further segmented by different industries; 
				specifically, Antiox will focus on college students due to their overwhelming schedules
				 and their shortage of time. Additionally, we want to work with the market that we’re 
				 most familiar with, which is why we chose to target college students within the Greater Boston Area.

			<h4>Market Size</h4>
			<h5>Our market at large consists of the 20.4 million college students attending school 
				in the United States. This number is has grown by 33% since the year 2000, and is 
				expected to keep going as the United States’ economy is increasingly expecting a college 
				degree for more and more positions. Our beachhead market, consisting of college students 
				at academically rigorous institutions in the greater Boston area (Boston University, 
				Harvard University, Boston College, Northeastern University, Tufts University, MIT) is made

		<h6> Our Product</h6>
		<h5>A transdermal patch with vitamins and antioxidants and a mobile app to provide 
			our product. After surveying individuals in our target audience, we decided to focus our patches on 
			solving three main issues.  The first will be an immune and skin care patch. Our third and final patch 
			will be a hangover patch. 
			</h5>	
		<h4> Value</h4>	
		<h5> The value that Antiox offers students is the ability to maintain a healthy balance between
			 sleep, physical health, mental health, and academic success. Our patch allows vitamins and 
			 antioxidants to diffuse across the skin over just a few hours, much faster than other daily vitamins. 
			 Antiox gives students the solution to remain healthy while living their not-so healthy lifestyles.
