				<h6>The Task:</h6>
				<h5> KilnLink is a cloud based Kiln Monitoring System that allows you to check 
					the status of your kiln from anywhere you have access to the internet. The task here was
					to develop the user interface for an app serving to monitor and control Skutt KilnLinks’s 
					ceramic kilns.
				</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm">
				<h6>My Approach:</h6>
				<h5> After researching the current problems with KilnLink’s Interface and reviewing the criteria 
					most essential to Skutt, I created an interface that emphasized the most important aspects 
					necessary to be successful. It was crucial that the system be easy to naviagte 
					and less intimidating than the current interface. 
				</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm">
				<h6> User Research:</h6>
				<h5>
					After interviewing Skutt Kiln users, we found that the most important features necessary to improve the current interface were
					to display energy consumption, temperature in various areas of the kiln, ventilation system airflow, 
					firing time elapsed, kiln lock status, and external temperature at thermocouple location.

				The image below is the home page of the original interface for Skutt Kilns. While some of the information is clear,
				the graphs are hard to follow and individuals noted that the most important information was not 
				easy to find.

				The image below is the home page of the improved interface. A navigation bar with five tabs is displayed on the bottom of the screen to allow 
				for easy navigation from one page to the next. A white stripe appears at the top of the chosen tab to indicate 
				which page the user is on. From a glance, the user is able to see all of their kilns and important information including
				 the status, temperature, and time remaining on each kiln. Additionally, the user is given the option to "stop firing".
