		<h1> Erica Albert </h1>
			<p> I grew up in Beverly, Massachusetts. I have a twin brother (currently at Northeastern University) and a sister one year older than me (currently she is a junior at Syracuse University in NY). During high school I ran varsity cross-country and ran track for four years. I was President of the Best Buddies club at my high school; this was a club that worked with kids who had intellectual and developmental disabilities. I also was a part of the National Honor Society, Peer Leaders program, and Eco-club. In my free time I enjoy reading and running. </p>
